# 🌊 Sprinklo  
### The Universal Mechanical Water Cap  
**Sprinkle. Drink. Zero Damage.**

Sprinklo is a sustainable, mechanical replacement bottle cap designed to solve a common everyday problem: children poking holes in water bottle caps. Instead of damaging bottles, Sprinklo transforms them into a **multi-functional, reusable water tool**—without causing leaks or waste.

---

## 🛑 The Problem

- **Cap Destruction**  
  Children frequently poke holes in bottle caps to create a “spray” effect.

- **Massive Leakage**  
  These holes can’t be resealed, leading to soaked school bags, ruined books, and wasted water.

- **Plastic Waste**  
  Once a cap is damaged, the entire bottle is often thrown away.

---

## 💡 The Solution

Sprinklo turns a destructive habit into a **durable, reusable feature**.

- 100% **mechanical** (no electronics)
- **Reusable & leak-proof**
- Fits **95% of standard water bottles** (28mm neck)
- Supports **spraying, drinking, and travel lock modes**

## ⚙️ Mechanical Logic & Features

Sprinklo uses a **3-Layer Mechanical Logic System** to ensure precision flow and zero leakage.

### 🔩 Three-Layer System

1. **Layer 01: Top Structural Layer**  
   Industrial-grade polymer head that rotates to align or misalign spray holes.

2. **Layer 02: Medical Silicone Barrier**  
   The flexible core that ensures a liquid-tight seal during transport and prevents leakage between moving parts.

3. **Layer 03: Inner Mechanical Control**  
   Controls internal port alignment for *Spray Mode* or fully seals the system for *Travel Mode*.

## 🔄 Operational Modes

- **Gravity Spray (Rotate)**  
  Rotate the top to align holes and invert the bottle to activate a controlled sprinkle powered by gravity.

- **Push to Drink (Mechanical)**  
  Press the top surface to bypass sprinkle ports and enable high-volume drinking via the outer silicone ring.

- **Travel Lock**  
  Rotate to misalign ports or engage the outer screw mechanism (concept) for complete sealing during rough transport.
